# Project Home

A simple Genetic Program to get in the top 100 for the main Numer.ai competition

## Installation

Run the python file after changing the directory to point to the current Numer.ai data

## Usage

python allornothing.py will produce two files.  Genetic Programming discovered the basic models. The output was then used for predictions; one is optimistic where as one is feature neutralized.
python symmetric.py will also produce files.  One uses a GP Relu function and the other uses a Sigmoid Function to discover a symmetric representation of the data.  Predictions are then made using linear algebra.
